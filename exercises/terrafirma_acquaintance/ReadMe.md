#greet the world

This is the first exercise and in it we will learn about how to run a ruby script
and the format of this course.

If you are at this step we will assume that you have ruby and bundler installed
## Getting started

While in this directory run
```
Bundle install
```
This will install all of the nessasry dependencys for this task. All future exercises will also require this step

Test driven devlopment is a part of what ruby as a culture is. It is not nessasary that you write tests but it is suggessted.
To make it easer to get started I will be writing the test for you to begin with. here is the first set of tests you will see.

```
bundle exec rspec spec
```

Your exercise is to make it make the test run
